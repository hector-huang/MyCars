# MyCars
1. This project adopts reactive programming paradigm implemented by RxSwift, so please run pod install first and run .workspace after that.
2. Please note in editing/creating car info screen, the input of car brand must be validated, and there's a real-time dropdown hint to let you know which car brands are acceptable.
3. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern is followed in architecting car info edit screen and combined with RxSwift
4. Batch read process from core data is optimized by asynchronous fetching.
5. Most of core business logics are unit tested.
